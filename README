Demonstration of embeddeding Molecular Workbench as an applet and as as an OTrunk Applet using aspects to instrument both MW and OTModelerPage.

The jars used are located in these directories:

  5.8M    lib/mw
  7.9M    lib/mw-aspects
  1.2M    lib/otrunk

lib/mw contains the MW applet jar dsitributed here:  http://mw2.concord.org/public/lib/mwapplet.jar

This jar is only used with mw_applet1.html.

lib/mw-aspects contains a variation on this jar: mw-aspects.jar built by maven with some (??) changes to work with the aspect-oriented logging system.

I'm not sure why mw-aspects.jar is 2.2 MB bigger than mwapplet.jar.

  $ ls -lh lib/mw-aspects/mw-aspects.jar lib/mw/mwapplet.jar 
  -rw-r--r--  1 stephen  staff   7.9M Apr 20 22:18 lib/mw-aspects/mw-aspects.jar
  -rw-r--r--  1 stephen  staff   5.7M Apr 20 22:18 lib/mw/mwapplet.jar

Without that difference adding the support for wrapping MW in OTrunk appears to just add 1.2 MB.
